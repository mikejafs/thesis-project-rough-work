"""
Module designed to hold the simulation class for all of my corrcal tests. As such, the goal is to make a class that
will allow me to make instances of cases of different types of parameters of interest for speed tests, accuracy tests
etc... This will allievate the need to begin all of my test notebooks with a large cell creating the list of parameters
of interest.
