Since the profiler launches a bunch of timers, this introduces overhead which may cause gpu run time. Additionally, it could be that since these streams are launched no matter what, the pgu side of things just ends up reading the wall time, though this is slightly speculation."

If we think carefully about what the profiler is doing, it may make sense that the times are the same in many cases. Since the cpu time is the total time spent on the cpu, and the gpu time is simply the total time spent durinig which the gpu carried out the computations, the times will differ, unless \n",
